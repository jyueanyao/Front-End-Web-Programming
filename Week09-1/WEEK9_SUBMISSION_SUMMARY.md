## 📊 Evidence of Planning

### **User-Centered Approach**:
My wireframes prioritize user needs I've identified through my own experience and observations of fellow design students:
- Clear navigation that doesn't overwhelm new designers
- Progressive disclosure of information (overview → details)
- Multiple ways to discover content (browse, search, filter)
- Mobile-first design for accessibility on all devices

### **Technical Feasibility**:
- Daily milestones ensure steady progress
- Must-have vs. nice-to-have features identified
- Risk mitigation strategies in place
- Buffer time built into timeline
- Leveraging existing design system patterns from current portfolio

### **Scalability & Maintenance**:
- Clean, modular code structure planned
- JSON-based content management for easy updates
- GitHub workflow for version control and deployment
- Documentation for future enhancements

## 💬 Reflection

This project represents a perfect intersection of my design background and my growing front-end development skills. By building something I genuinely need and would use, I'm ensuring that the motivation and attention to detail will carry me through the intensive Week 10 development period.

The scope is ambitious but achievable, with clear fallback plans if technical challenges arise. Most importantly, this project will serve as both a learning experience and a valuable addition to my professional toolkit beyond this course.
