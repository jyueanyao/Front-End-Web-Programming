# Individual Final Project Proposal

## Project Idea: "DesignersToolkit" - A Curated Resource Hub for Emerging UX/UI Designers

### Project Overview
I will create a comprehensive digital resource hub specifically designed for emerging UX/UI designers like myself. This website will serve as a one-stop destination for design resources, career guidance, and community insights that I wish I had when starting my design journey. The site will feature curated tool recommendations, career roadmaps, portfolio tips, and emerging trends in design.

### Goals & Purpose
The primary goal is to create a valuable resource that helps new designers navigate the overwhelming landscape of design tools, learning resources, and career paths. Many emerging designers struggle with knowing which tools to learn, how to build a strong portfolio, and how to break into the industry. This site will bridge that knowledge gap by providing curated, actionable guidance based on real industry experience and current market demands. Additionally, this project will demonstrate my front-end development skills while showcasing my understanding of user-centered design principles.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Recent graduates and career changers entering UX/UI design (ages 22-35)
- **Secondary**: Design students looking for practical industry insights
- **Tertiary**: Junior designers seeking to advance their skills and build their portfolios

### Why This Project?
This project leverages my unique position as someone currently in the transition phase of their design career. I can provide authentic, relatable guidance while building something that will continue to be useful for my own professional development. The site will also serve as a living portfolio piece that demonstrates both my design thinking and technical implementation skills.
